## Common open source workflow

When working on a project that is open source, for instance at Github, then it is usually preferred that you work in the following way.

- Find the project on Github that you want to work on.
- Create a fork of that repository (a fork is a copy of the code on your own account).
- Clone the fork (the code from your own account) to your local computer.
- Do work!
- Make one or more commits with well-written commit messages.
- Push your commits to your fork on Github.
- When all this is done you can create a pull-request (PR).
- If you need to make changes before the PR is accepted, do those iteratively until eventually the PR is accepted.

### Pull request

In the resource link below, Github has explained in detail what a pull-request is. In short, it's when you've forked a project - done work and have a new version ready that you want to merge into _the original_ repository. Then you create a pull-request so the code maintainers for that project can bring in your updates to their original code.
