_Learn the foundations about how to use git source control._

## Basic commands

- `git status` - _See the status of your repository, if you have any file changes or new files etc._
- `git diff` - _See what changes were made to your files._
- `git pull` - _Pull changes from remote, to your local computer. Updates your code with new changes._
- `git push` - _Push new changes (commits) that you have made to your code, up to the remote repository._
- `git add <file paths>` - _Put changes to your code on stage, meaning prepare them for a commit._
- `git commit` - _Commit to changes in your code. This will create a new 'patch' or version of your code._
- `git fetch` - _Retrieve new updates about branches of your repository that happened remotely._
